Solving coding problems from the [Euler Project](https://projecteuler.net/about)

Hey there! In my free time of the Fall senior semester, I'm teaching myself R! I figure I'd better practice it as I read along in the textbook, 
so I'm workking through Project Euler problems to test both my Math and Computer Science knowledge!
